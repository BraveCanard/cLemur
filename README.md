## **Project Overview**

In the face of a major life eventâ€”whether itâ€™s a fire, flood, or theftâ€”documenting every item lost or damaged can be an exhausting process. **cLemur** is here to take that burden off your shoulders. This tool collects, cleans, standardizes, and organizes data from invoices, receipts, and product information to streamline claims.

Through automation, cLemur is designed to connect your purchase history, photographic evidence, and other relevant data sources. Imagine claiming items from Amazon, organizing receipts, and having an intuitive process to validate and submit insurance claimsâ€”all in a simple and efficient workflow.

## **Why cLemur?**

Claim processes can be tedious. Insurance companies often rely on manual, outdated processes that discourage people from completing their claims. But what if, instead of countless hours, this could be done with a few clicks?

- **Purpose**: Built for those dealing with complex post-incident documentation.
- **Vision**: To simplify claims for everyone, from individuals to small businesses.
- **Impact**: cLemur helps users reclaim their losses with dignity, minimizing frustration.

Whether itâ€™s parsing your Amazon receipts, organizing product data, or helping you document your claim, cLemur ensures the process is intuitive, user-friendly, and as close to automated as possible.
